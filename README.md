# Emoji-Match
This is a Java implementation of a sliding block puzzle game. Players need to slide emoji tiles on a game board to combine them until they get the angry reacts emoji. Once the game ends, the player's name is added to the leaderboard, which displays the top players. The game ends either when the angry reacts emoji is created, or the board fills up with tiles and there are no remaining possible moves.
